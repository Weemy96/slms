## Don't know how to use Git?
Read [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [here](http://try.github.io/). After reading the documentation also don't know to use? OK, fine. Download GitHub Desktop, easy for you.

#### Windows and macOS

It's recommended to use AppImage, no need to install.

GitKraken is also a nice choice, but need logging in with GitHub/GitKraken account. (**Non-commercial use is FREE!**)

#### Windows and macOS

If your Linux PC don't have snap, refer [here](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install).
